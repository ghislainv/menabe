  Abstract                 = {Establishing cause-effect relationships for deforestation at various scales has proven difficult even when rates of deforestation appear well documented. There is a need for better explanatory models, which also provide insight into the process of deforestation. We propose a novel hierarchical modeling specification incorporating spatial association. The hierarchical aspect allows us to accommodate misalignment between the land-use (response) data layer and explanatory data layers. Spatial structure seems appropriate due to the inherently spatial nature of land use and data layers explaining land use. Typically, there will be missing values or holes in the response, data. To accommodate this we propose an imputation strategy. We apply our modeling approach to develop a novel deforestation model for the eastern wet forested zone of Madagascar, a global rain forest "hot spot". Using five data layers created for this region, we fit a suitable spatial hierarchical model. Though fitting such models is computationally much more demanding than fitting more standard models, we show that the resulting interpretation is much richer. Also, we employ a model choice criterion to argue that our fully Bayesian model performs better than simpler ones. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that applies hierarchical Bayesian modeling techniques to study deforestation processes. We conclude with a discussion of our findings and an indication of the broader ecological applicability of our modeling style. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. },

The tropics were the only climate domain to exhibit a trend, with forest loss increasing by 2101 square kilometers per year. Brazil’s well-documented reduction in deforestation was offset by increasing forest loss in Indonesia, Malaysia, Paraguay, Bolivia, Zambia, Angola, and elsewhere. Intensive forestry practiced within subtropical forests resulted in the highest rates of forest change globally. Boreal forest loss due largely to fire and forestry was second to that in the tropics in absolute and proportional terms. These results depict a globally consistent and locally relevant record of forest change.},

Madagascar's forests are among the most biologically rich and unique in the world but, in spite of longstanding concern about their destruction, past estimates of forest cover and deforestation have varied widely. Analysis of aerial photographs (c. 1953) and Landsat images (c. 1973, c. 1990 and c. 2000) indicates that forest cover decreased by almost 40% from the 1950s to c. 2000, with a reduction in 'core forest' > 1 km from a non-forest edge of almost 80%. This forest destruction and degradation threaten thousands of species with extinction. Country-wide coverage of high-resolution validated forest cover and deforestation data enables the precise monitoring of trends in habitat extent and fragmentation critical for assessment of species' conservation status.},

  Abstract                 = {Anthropogenic deforestation in tropical countries is responsible for a significant part of global carbon dioxide emissions in the atmosphere. To plan efficient climate change mitigation programs (such as REDD+, Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation), reliable forecasts of deforestation and carbon dioxide emissions are necessary. Although population density has been recognized as a key factor in tropical deforestation, current methods of prediction do not allow the population explosion that is occurring in many tropical developing countries to be taken into account. Here, we propose an innovative approach using novel computational and statistical tools, including R/GRASS scripts and the new phcfM R package, to model the intensity and location of deforestation including the effect of population density. We used the model to forecast anthropogenic deforestation and carbon dioxide emissions in five large study areas in the humid and spiny-dry forests of Madagascar. Using our approach, we were able to demonstrate that the current rapid population growth in Madagascar (+3.39% per year) will significantly increase the intensity of deforestation by 2030 (up to +1.17% per year in densely populated areas). We estimated the carbon dioxide emissions associated with the loss of aboveground biomass to be of 2.24 and 0.26 tons per hectare and per year in the humid and spiny-dry forest, respectively. Our models showed better predictive ability than previous deforestation models (the figure of merit ranged from 10 to 23). We recommend this approach to reduce the uncertainty associated with deforestation forecasts. We also underline the risk of an increase in the speed of deforestation in the short term in tropical developing countries undergoing rapid population expansion.},

abstract="There has been much recent interest in Bayesian image analysis, including such topics as removal of blur and noise, detection of object boundaries, classification of textures, and reconstruction of two- or three-dimensional scenes from noisy lower-dimensional views. Perhaps the most straightforward task is that of image restoration, though it is often suggested that this is an area of relatively minor practical importance. The present paper argues the contrary, since many problems in the analysis of spatial data can be interpreted as problems of image restoration. Furthermore, the amounts of data involved allow routine use of computer intensive methods, such as the Gibbs sampler, that are not yet practicable for conventional images. Two examples are given, one in archeology, the other in epidemiology. These are preceded by a partial review of pixel-based Bayesian image analysis.",

Climate change is expected to disproportionately affect smallholder farmers and make their livelihoods even more precarious; however, there is limited information on their overall vulnerability and adaptation needs. We conducted surveys of 600 households in Madagascar to characterize the vulnerability of smallholder farmers, identify how farmers cope with risks and explore what strategies are needed to help them adapt to climate change. Malagasy farmers are particularly vulnerable to any shocks to their agricultural system owing to their high dependence on agriculture for their livelihoods, chronic food insecurity, physical isolation and lack of access to formal safety nets. Farmers are frequently exposed to pest and disease outbreaks and extreme weather events (particularly cyclones), which cause significant crop and income losses and exacerbate food insecurity. Although farmers use a variety of risk-coping strategies, these are insufficient to prevent them from remaining food insecure. Few farmers have adjusted their farming strategies in response to climate change, owing to limited resources and capacity. Urgent technical, financial and institutional support is needed to improve the agricultural production and food security of Malagasy farmers and make their livelihoods resilient to climate change.},

a Malthusian spiral of increased population and decreased land productivity. Whilst there has been a wealth of research on deforestation in Madagascar, it has tended to assume a priori the importance of population growth and poverty as drivers of forest clearance, without exploring the role
of other factors in shaping land use. It has also suffered from temporal and regional biases. In this paper I use a multidisciplinary approach to better understand the drivers of land use and landscape change in the Central Menabe region of western Madagascar between 1896 and 2005. I draw
on a diverse range of methods including material from the French colonial archives, aerial photographs, imagery from Landsat satellites, a review of project reports and interviews with key informants. I show the importance of cash crops in landscape change, in particular booms in the cultivation
of maize. I also show that economic and political factors operating at a range of spatial levels have been critical in stimulating the expansion of these crops.},

abstract = { AbstractShifting cultivators are often held responsible for deforestation in the humid tropics. The neo-Malthusian link between population growth and shifting cultivation negates historical considerations of the political economy of deforestation in specific places. Using concepts drawn from regional geography and political ecology, this paper examines the role played by the colonial state in the organization of land use and agriculture as central to an explanation of deforestation in Madagascar. Almost three-quarters of the primary forest was cleared from 1895 to 1925 due to the state's economic objectives, ideologically expressed as a concern for rational forest management and conservation. This concern prompted a ban on shifting cultivation. The Malagasy interpreted the ban as depriving them of independent access to subsistence and forcing them into wage work. This case study demonstrates how ideas concerning shifting cultivation and deforestation are political constructions of various groups with specific material interests. A synthesis of the political ecology and regional geography perspectives reveals how a consideration of the interactions among human groups, the environment, and social formations is central to a regional explanation of tropical deforestation. Population growth and shifting cultivation practices cannot fully account for deforestation in Madagascar during the colonial period.}

Madagascar, like other globally recognized biodiversity hot spots, has complex spatial patterns of endemism that differ among taxonomic groups, creating challenges for the selection of within-country priorities. We show, in an analysis of wide taxonomic and geographic breadth and high spatial resolution, that multitaxonomic rather than single-taxon approaches are critical for identifying areas likely to promote the persistence of most species. Our conservation prioritization, facilitated by newly available techniques, identifies optimal expansion sites for the Madagascar government{\textquoteright}s current goal of tripling the land area under protection. Our findings further suggest that high-resolution multitaxonomic approaches to prioritization may be necessary to ensure protection for biodiversity in other global hot spots.},

  Abstract                 = {Recent proposals to compensate developing countries for reducing emissions from deforestation (RED) under forthcoming climate change mitigation regimes are receiving increasing attention. Here we demonstrate that if RED credits were traded on international carbon markets, even moderate decreases in deforestation rates could generate billions of Euros annually for tropical forest conservation. We also discuss the main challenges for a RED mechanism that delivers real climatic benefits. These include providing sufficient incentives while only rewarding deforestation reductions beyond business-as-usual scenarios, addressing risks arising from forest degradation and international leakage, and ensuring permanence of emission reductions. Governance may become a formidable challenge for RED because some countries with the highest RED potentials score poorly on governance indices. In addition to climate mitigation, RED funds could help achieve substantial co-benefits for biodiversity conservation and human development. However, this will probably require targeted additional support because the highest biodiversity threats and human development needs may exist in countries that have limited income potentials from RED. In conclusion, how successfully a market-based RED mechanism can contribute to climate change mitigation, conservation and development will strongly depend on accompanying measures and carefully designed incentive structures involving governments, business, as well as the conservation and development communities. },

abstract = "Abstract The environmental impact of the early human inhabitants of Madagascar remains heavily debated. We present results from a study using two stalagmites collected from Anjohibe Cave in northwestern Madagascar to investigate the paleoecology and paleoclimate of northwestern Madagascar over the past 1800 years. Carbon stable isotopic data indicate a rapid, complete transformation from a flora dominated by \{C3\} plants to a \{C4\} grassland system. This transformation is well replicated in both stalagmites, occurred at 890 \{CE\} and was completed within one century. We infer that the change was the result of a dramatic increase in the use of fire to promote the growth of grass for cattle fodder. Further, stalagmite oxygen isotope ratios show no significant variation across the carbon isotope excursion, demonstrating that the landscape transformation was not related to changes in precipitation. Our study illustrates the profound impact early inhabitants had on the environment, and implies that forest loss was one trigger of megafaunal extinction. "
