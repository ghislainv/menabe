## Historical deforestation maps

We used 30 m resolution cloud-free forest cover maps available for Madagascar for the years 1990, 2000, 2010, and 2015 [@Vieilledent2018;@Vieilledent2018data]. These maps were obtained combining the 1990 and 2000 forest cover maps by @Harper2007 and the 2000--2015 tree cover loss data by @Hansen2013. We used these national forest cover maps to derive forest cover change maps for the periods 1990--2000, 2000--2010, and 2010--2015 for our three study areas around the Menabe-Antimena New Protected Area (E: 44.20934, W: 44.81850, S: -20.36440, N: -19.55838, in decimal degrees), the Kirindy-Mite National Park (E: 43.67555, W: 44.35049, S: -21.38515, N: -20.50082), and the Mikea National Park (E: 43.11582, W: 44.17152, S: -22.98611, N: -21.62237).

For each period and each study area, we computed the mean annual deforested area (in ha/yr), and the mean annual deforestation rate $\theta$ (in %/yr) using the forest cover estimates $F_1$ and $F_2$ at dates $t_1$ and $t_2$ and the following formula [@Puyravaud2003;@Vieilledent2013]: $\theta=1-(1-(F_1-F_2)/F_1)^{(1/T)}$, with $T=t_2-t_1$ (in yr). 

Field work was conducted during two weeks in March and June 2016 to verify the presence of the recent (2000--2010--2015) patches of deforestation in the three study areas. We validated the deforestation maps on this period and identified the main causes of deforestation in the three study areas. 

## Deforestation model

Following @Vieilledent2013, we considered two processes for modelling deforestation, a first one describing the intensity of deforestation (number of hectares of forest deforested each year) and a second one describing the location of the deforestation (spatial probability of deforestation). For the intensity of deforestation, we used two historical means at the study area level considering a conservative scenario (S1) and a worst-case scenario (S2). The conservative scenario assumed a lower deforestation rate corresponding to the mean annual deforestation observed on the period 1990--2010. The worst-case scenario assumed a higher deforestation rate corresponding to the mean annual deforestation observed on the period 2000--2015, during which the deforestation has dramatically increased.

For the location of the deforestation, we used a map of the spatial probability of deforestation at 30 m resolution for the year 2010 for Madagascar. The map is freely available at <https:/bioscenemada.cirad.fr/forestmaps>. We used this national map for our three study areas (Appendix 1). The map was derived from a Binomial logistic regression model of deforestation where the observed deforestation at the pixel level on the period 2000--2010 was explained by several environmental spatial variables. Altitude, distance to forest edge, distance to main town, distance to main road, protected areas, and distance to past deforestation (period 1990--2000) were used as explanatory variables. These variables describe the accessibility, the land policy and the historical deforestation. The model also included spatial random effects at the regional scale (10 $\times$ 10 km grid cells) to account for the residual variability in the deforestation process which is not explained by the environmental variables (see <https://ghislainv.github.io/forestatrisk> for more details on model specifications).

To forecast the forest cover in 2050 for our three study areas, we removed the 2010 forest pixels with the highest probability of deforestation following the annual deforestation rate of the two intensity scenarios considered (conservative scenario S1 and worst-case scenario S2). As a rough validation of our projections, we computed the percentage of observed deforestation on the period 2010--2015 included in the predicted deforestation on the period 2010--2050.

## Surveys

During two weeks in March and June 2016, we conducted surveys among local farmers and environmental stakeholders (Tab. \@ref(tab:surveys)) in the three study areas. The objectives of the surveys were first to identify the causes of the deforestation and second to assess the efficiency of the conservation actions implemented by the NGOs in charge of the management of the protected areas, either Fanamby for MANAP or Madagascar National Parks for KMNP and MIKEA. Surveys were qualitative and included non-directive questions (no "yes-or-no" questions). Discussing with the _"Fokontany"_ chief at Lambokely, we also obtained rough population estimates on the period 2010--2015 for the two villages of Kirindy and Lambokely. The _"Fokontany"_ is a Malagasy administrative unit under the level of the township. Information from field surveys was cross-checked and complemented by a review of technical reports on the maize and peanut sectors in Madagascar [@Youssi2008; @MAEP2004; @ChanMouie2016; @Fauroux2000] and scientific studies on the deforestation process in south-east Madagascar [@Scales2011; @Zinner2014; @Fauroux2000; @Reau2002; @Casse2004; @Gardner2013]. We also used the FAOSTAT website (<http://www.fao.org/faostat>) to get information on the national production of maize and peanut and the UN Comtrade website (<https://comtrade.un.org>) to get information on the exportations.
