## Intensity and pattern of deforestation

Deforestation rates have continuously increased since 1990 for the two study areas (Table 2). We estimated that 3,960 ha and 3,295 ha of forest have disappeared annually on the period 2010-2017 in the study areas around KMNP and MANPA, respectively. This represent annual deforestation rates of about 2.35%.yr$-1$. The annual deforestation has more than doubled on the period 2010-2017 compared to the period 2000-2010 (0.85%.yr$-1$). In the study area around KMNP, mosaic deforestation associated to slash-and-burn agriculture occurred outside the protected area, showing a relative effectiveness of the protected area to prevent deforestation (Fig. 2b, label A). Much larger patches of deforestation have been observed on the period 2010-2017 on the east part of the protected area associated to uncontrolled fires after cyclone events (Fig. 2b, label B). Dispersed and small-scale deforestation has also been observed in the northern and western part of the park associated to illegal logging activities (Fig. 2b, label C). In the Menabe-Antimena New Protected Area, large patches of deforestation associated to slash-and-burn agriculture were identified around the Kirindy and Lambokely villages and at the south of Belo-sur-Tsiribihina town (Fig. 2a).

## Deforestation drivers

### Proximate causes of deforestation: slash-and-burn agriculture, uncontrolled fires and illegal logging

In the study area around the Menabe-Antimena New Protected Area, the main cause of deforestation was the slash-and-burn agriculture (locally known as _"hatsake"_) for maize (_Zea mays_ (Linné)) and peanut (_Arachis hypogaea_ (Linné)) crop (Fig. 2a). The burning of forest provides nutrient rich ash and light for crops. Peanut is cultivated as cash crop and is transformed into peanut oil. A part of the production is at the destination of the national market but most of it is exported outside Madagascar, mainly for the Chinese market (Fig. 3). Maize is cultivated for auto-consumption and as cash crop. The production of maize is at the destination of the national and regional market (Fig. 3). Peanut and maize are sold by farmers to resellers at the price of 1400 Ariary (MGA) and 400 Ariary per kilo, respectively. For 2016, the production for a household was of 1.6 T of peanut and 2.5 T of maize, thus providing an annual income of about 3.24 millions MGA. With the money earned from the sale of the maize and peanut harvest, farmers invest in zebu herd acquisition.

We identified three causes of deforestation in the study area around the Kirindy-Mite National Park (Fig. 2b). Slash-and-burn agriculture for maize crops was identified as the main cause of deforestation in several areas at the periphery of the protected area (Fig. 2b, label A). Inside the protected area, uncontrolled fires were identified as the main cause of deforestation (Fig. 2b, label B). People repeatedly set fire on former grasslands (_"bozake"_) outside the protected area to obtain flush of green pasture for their livestock. When uncontrolled, fires can spread on large areas of the forest and cross the boundaries of the protected area. In 2009, the cyclone named _"Fanele"_ impacted a large area of the forest in the Kirindy-Mite National Park leaving a lot of wood fuel on the ground. This has allowed uncontrolled fires to spread on large areas of the park in the years following the cyclone (Fig. 2b, label B). These fires were difficultly stopped with water and sand by the agents of the park with the help of the local villagers. Illegal logging was also identified as a cause of deforestation in Kirindy-Mitea (Fig. 2b, label C). Timbers are mainly used for house and boat construction and sold in local markets in Belo-sur-Mer and Morondava towns. 

### Ultimate causes of deforestation

#### Demographic growth and migration

Population increase in central Menabe, associated to demographic growth and migration, have accentuated the pressure on forest. The population of Kirindy and Lambokely villages (Fig. 2a) has been roughly multiplied by 5 between 2010 and 2015 (from about 600 to 3000 inhabitants for Kirindy and from 1000 to 5000 for Lambokely). This was both due to demographic growth and migration. The demographic rate in Madagascar is close to 3%.yr$-1$ [@Vieilledent2013] which means that the population doubles each 25 years on average. In Lambokely and Kirindy villages, the families we surveyed had all more than six children. Also the possibility of cropping cash crops have attracted many people from the south of Madagascar during the last years, in particular from the _"Androy"_ region (southeastern Madagascar). First migrants arrived in the central Menabe to work in large agricultural concessions authorized by the French colonial government. Notably, many _"Tandroy"_ migrants have arrived in the 1960s and established near the Beroboka village (located between Kirindy and Lambokely villages) to work in the sisal (_Agave sisalana_ (Perrine, 1838)) plantation of the de Heaulme family which is now abandoned. Moreover, consecutive droughts reported in southeastern Madagascar resulted in severe famines there, that forced several thousand _"Tandroy"_ families to migrate to Menabe region in search for new farming land. 

#### Limits in the application of conservation policy

Forest clearance is illegal in Madagascar since 1987 (Décret n°87-143, 20 April 1987), even outside the protected areas. However, the law is not respected nor applied. Almost nobody is prosecuted for forest clearance. During our stay in the field, seven people were arrested for doing slash-and-burn agriculture but were relaxed a few days later. The political crisis of 2009, followed by several years of political instability, has reinforced this state of lawlessness. Moreover, authorities commonly have economic interests in not curbing deforestation as they are often involved in the trade associated with cash crops. Indeed, many politics in Madagascar are also business leaders. Regarding the structures in charge of the management of the protected areas, such as Fanamby and Madagascar National Parks NGOs, they have no legal enforcement powers which are retained by local Government agencies. Thus, their unique role concerning forest conservation in the field is limited to population awareness of the forest conservation issues, to inventory and monitor the biodiversity in the parks, and to organize patrols to discourage forest clearance or report offences. But in any case they have the right to arrest people or to draw up a report and decide on a fine. NGOs also engage people as conservation partners (then named _"polis ny ala"_) to try to make them stewards of their forest but they have practically no power and will difficultly report illegal acts from known neighbours or relatives.

## Projected deforestation

p4 <- round(perc[2,3])
```

Following the conservative scenario S1 (projecting 1990-2010 mean annual deforestation) and the worst-case scenario S2 (projecting 2000-2017 mean annual deforestation), we predicted that 36-55% of the forest present in 2000 will have disappeared in 2050 (Table 3). On the period 2000-2017, around 17% of the forest have already disappeared. Forest in 2050 should remain preferentially in the protected areas but deforestation should not stop at the boundaries of the parks (Fig. 2c and 2d). The model predicted that deforestation in the future should occur close to places were deforestation occurred in the past, thus correctly simulating the contagious process of deforestation (Fig. 2). Deforestation is also more likely to occur at short distances to villages and roads and at the forest edge (Fig. 2c and 2d). Forest fragmentation is also predicted to increase in association to deforestation (higher number of disconnected forest patches in Fig. 2c and 2d). Most of the deforestation observed on the period 2010-2017 was included in the deforested area predicted by the model on the period 2010-2050, (`r p1`-`r p2`% for MANPA and `r p3`-`r p4`% for KMNP for scenarios S1 and S2, respectively) thus validating partly the predictions regarding the location of the future deforestation (Fig. 2c and 2d).
