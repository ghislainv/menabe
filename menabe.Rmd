## Summary

1. Madagascar is recognized for both its unparrallel biodiversity, concentrated mainly in tropical forests, and its high level of threat which is associated in particular to deforestation. Madagascar population, which is rapidly increasing, is one of the poorest in the world and people rely strongly on forests for their livelihood. Since the end of the colonization (in 1960), much effort has been done to fight poverty and curb deforestation through implementing large development and conservation programs. Despite this, Madagascar remains in the top countries with the highest deforestation rates and the forest cover, particularly in the western dry ecoregion, is rapidly decreasing. 

3. To try to explain why it is so difficult to stop deforestation in Madagascar, we analyzed further the deforestation process in two dry forest areas in the central Menabe (western Madagascar) around two protected areas with high biodiversity, the Kirindy-Mitea national park and the Menabe-Antimena new protected area. We derived historical deforestation maps for these two areas from Landsat satellite images on the periods 1990-2000-2010-2014. We validated these maps and identified the main causes of deforestation with field verification points and through household and stakeholder surveys. We then established a map of the future deforestation on the period 2010-2050 assuming a business-as-usual scenario.

4. We showed that deforestation had recently increased in the two study areas, with a deforestation rate of about 2.35%.yr<sup>-1</sup> on the period 2010-2014 compared to 0.85%.yr<sup>-1</sup> on the period 2000-2010. We identified two major causes of deforestation, the first one being illegal slash-and-burn agriculture for the cultivation of peanut and maize as cash crops, the second one being uncontrolled forest fires after cyclonic events. These fires are set by farmers in nearby grasslands to obtain flush of green pasture for livestock. Agents from institutions in charge of the management of the protected areas do not have the means to inforce law against deforestation. Slash-and-burn agriculture intensified recently due to the settlement or migrants following climate-induced famines in southern Madagascar. Money earned by farmers from peanut and maize productions is used to invest into zebu cows. Peanut production is exported outside Madagascar and a large part of the maize production is used to brew the national beers. These activities benefit to several intermediaries, some of who having political responsabilities, which underlies a conflict of interest in the application of the law against deforestation. 

5. _Conclusions:_ In the absence of an efficient strategy to stop deforestation, we expect that half of the forest present in 2000 will have disappeared before 2050. Forest loss, apart from biodiversity loss and climate-change global issues, will be at the expense of local population. Contrary to what is commonly accepted, deforestation in western Madagascar is not associated to agriculture for autoconsumption. International pressure should be put on the Malagasy government to apply in the first place the law of the environmental code and make use of repressive measures to stop deforestation. Of course, these measures must be accompagnied by incentive measures, through for example agricultural development programs, to offer alternatives to deforestation when necessary.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 State of the art

- Forests provide a multitude of services at the global scale (biodiversity, climate regulation) and to local communities (watershed, wood, non-woody products and alimentation) 
- Madagascar has long been recognized as a biodiversity hotspot highly threatened by deforestation
- Many actions have been implemented to curb deforestation in the country
    - Increase of the protected areas over 10% of the country total area
    - Large investment in development programs (number of NGOs in Madagascar and amout of money for agricultural development and conservation)
    - World Bank with the Environmental Program, USAID, AFD-FFEM, KFW

### 1.2 Knowledge gap

- Nonetheless, deforestation seems to remain very high in Madagascar and has recently increase in intensity despite all the conservation and development measures.
- Why such initiatives are failing and what could be the solution to stop deforestation?
- Is the recent deforestation attributable to external causes, independant of anthropogenic activities, such as climate change?
- Is it really possible to stop deforestation in Madagascar?

### 1.3 Objectives

- To try to answer these questions, we studied the intensity and the causes of deforestation in two protected areas located in western Madagascar and aiming at protecting the dry forest and its unique biodiversity.

## 2. Materials and Methods

### 2.1 Historical deforestation maps

We derived 30m cloud-free forest maps for Madagascar for the years 1990, 2000, 2010 and 2014 combining the 1990 and 2000 forest maps by @Harper2007 and the 2000-2014 tree percent cover map by @Hansen2013. On Harper's map, ~200,000 ha clouds are present over the ~4.2 million ha moist forest ecoregion (4.8% of clouds). To remove these clouds, we used the 2000 cloud-free tree percent cover map provided by @Hansen2013 (also at 30~m resolution) and we chose a threshold of 75% of tree cover to decide whether to replace cloud pixels with forest or non-forest pixels [@Achard2014]. We thus obtained a cloud-free year 2000 forest map for Madagascar. From this map, using tree cover loss data from 2000 to 2014 by @Hansen2013, we obtained cloud-free forest maps in 2010 and 2014 at 30~m resolution. Finally, we corrected the cloudy 1990 Harper forest map assuming that if forest was present in 2000, it was also present in 1990. Doing so, all clouds were removed and we obtained a cloud-free 1990 forest map for Madagascar. These maps are freely available at http:/bioscenemada.net/forestmaps. We then used these national maps for our regional study around the Kirindy-Mitea national park (E: 43.67555, W: 44.35067, S: -21.36469, N: -20.50137, in decimal degrees) and the Menabe-Antimena new protected area (E: 44.20934, W: 44.8185, S: -20.3644, N: -19.55838, in decimal degrees). Field work was conducting during a ten days mission in June 2016 to verify the presence of the recent (2000-2010-2014) patches of deforestation in the two study areas. We validated the deforestation maps on this period and identified the main causes of deforestation in the two study areas. 

### 2.2 Deforestation model

Following @Vieilledent2013, we considered two processes for modelling deforestation, a first one describing the intensity of deforestation (number of hectares of forest deforested each year) and a second one describing the location of the deforestation (spatial probability of deforestation). For the intensity of deforestation, we used two historical means at the study area level assuming a conservative scenario (S1) and a worst-case scenario (S2). The conservative scenario assumed a lower deforestation rate corresponding to the mean annual deforestation observed on the period 1990-2010. The worst-case scenario assumed a higher deforestation rate corresponding to the mean annual deforestation observed on the period 2000-2014, during which the deforestation has dramatically increased (Table 3). For the location of the deforestation, we estimated the parameters $\beta$ of a Binomial logistic regression linking the spatial probability of deforestation $\theta_i$ for forest pixel $i$ to a set of spatial explicative factors $X_i$ computed at the pixel level. To account for unexplained spatial variation in the probability of deforestation, we added a spatial random effect $\rho_{j(i)}$ at the level of the 10km resolution cell $j$ including the pixel $i$: $\text{logit}(\theta_i)=X_i\beta+\rho_{j(i)}$. To account for spatial autocorrelation, these spatial random effects were structured with a conditional autoregressive (CAR) model [@Besag1991] where $\rho_j$ depends on the values of $\rho_{j^{\prime}}$ for the neighbouring cells $j^{\prime}$. We used the deforestation data on the period 2000-2010 to fit the model. We used altitude, distance to forest edge, distance to main town, distance to main road, inclusion into a protected area and distance to past deforestation (period 1990-2000) as spatial explicative factors of the probability of deforestation [@Vieilledent2013]. These factors describe the accessibility, the land policy and the historical deforestation of the forest. Model parameters where estimated in a Bayesian framework using the function `hSDM.binomial.iCAR()` from the hSDM `R` package [@Vieilledent2014]. The 10km spatial random effect estimates were interpolated at 1km using a bilinear interpolation. Using the results of the statistical model, we derived a map of the spatial probability of deforestation at 30m resolution for the year 2010 for Madagascar. The map is freely available at http:/bioscenemada.net/forestmaps. We used this national map for our regional study (Fig. S1). To forecast the forest cover in 2050 for our two study areas, we removed the 2010 forest pixels with the highest probability of deforestation following the annual deforestation rate of the two intensity scenarios considered (conservative scenario S1 and worst-case scenario S2).

### 2.3 Surveys

During a ten days period in June 2016, we conducted surveys among farmers and environmental stakeholders (Table 1) around the Kirindy-Mitea national park and the Menabe-Antimena new protected area. The objectives of the surveys were first to identify the causes of the deforestation and second to assess the efficiency of the conservation actions implemented by the institution in charge of the management of the protected areas, either the non-governmental organisation _"Fanamby"_" for the Menabe-Antimena new protected area or Madagascar National Park for the Kirindy-Mitea national park. Surveys were qualitative and included non-directive questions (no "yes-or-no" questions). Discussing with the _"Fokontany"_ chief at Lambokely, we also obtained the numbers of the population estimates on the period 2010-2015 for the two villages of Kirindy and Lambokely. The _"Fokontany"_ is a Malagasy administrative unit under the level of the township.

Table 1: **List of surveys conducted among farmers and environmental stakeholders**. Surveys were conducted around the Kirindy-Mitea national park and the Menabe-Antimena new protected area. The _"Fokontany"_ is a Malagasy term defining an administrative territory under the level of the township. In Madagascar, the management of the protected areas are under the responsability of Madagascar National Parks (MNP) or delegated to an environmental Non-Governmental Organisation (such as the NGO Fanamby for Menabe-Antimena new protected areas). 

## 3. Results

### 3.1 Historical deforestation

The deforestation rate has continuously increased since 1990 for the two study areas (Table 2). We estimated that 3960 ha and 3295 ha of forest have disappeared annually on the period 2010-2014 in the study areas around the Kirindy-Mitea national park and the Menabe-Antimena new protected area, respectively. This represent annual deforestation rates of about 2.35%.yr<sup>-1</sup>. The annual deforestation has more than doubled on the period 2010-2014 compared to the period 2000-2010, with an annual deforestation rate on this period of about 0.85%.yr<sup>-1</sup>. In the study area around the Kirindy-Mitea national park, mosaic deforestation associated to slash-and-burn agriculture occured outside the protected area, showing a relative effectiveness of the protected area to prevent deforestation (Fig. 2a, label A). Much larger patches of deforestation have been observed on the period 2010-2014 on the east part of the protected area associated to uncontrolled fires after cyclone events (Fig. 2a, label B). Dispersed and small-scale deforestation has also been observed in the northern and western part of the park associated to illegal logging activities (Fig. 2a, label B). In the Menabe-Antimena new protected area, large patches of deforestation were surprisingly not associated to uncontrolled fires but to slash-and-burn agriculture. Most of the deforestation occured around the Kirindy and Lambokely villages and at the south of Belo-sur-Tsiribihina (Fig. 2a).

In the Menabe-Antimena study area, the main cause of the deforestation is the slash-and-burn agriculture (_"hatsake"_) for maize and peanut crops. Most of the 2000-2014 deforestation occured around the villages of Kirindy and Lambokely. In the Kirindy-Mitea study area, the main causes of deforestation are (A) slash-and-burn agriculture, (B) cyclones followed by uncontrolled fires and (C) illegal logging. **c-d**: _Projected deforestation on the period 2010-2050._ Green: projected forest cover in 2050, light grey: 2010-2050 deforestation following conservative scenario S1 (projecting 1990-2010 mean annual deforestation), dark grey: 2010-2050 additional deforestation following scenario S2 (projecting 2000-2014 mean annual deforestation). Most of the 2010-2014 deforestation observed on panels (a-b) is included in the 2010-2050 projections. We predicted a loss of 36-55% of the forest cover in 2050 compared to 2000 depending on the scenario. Most of the remaining forest will be inside the protected areas.](figs/deforestation.png)

### 3.2 Causes of deforestation

#### 3.2.1 Slash-and-burn agriculture, uncontrolled fires and illegal logging

In the study area around the Menabe-Antimena new protected area, the main cause of deforestation was the slash-and-burn agriculture (also know as _"hatsake"_) for maize (_Zea mays_ (Linné)) and peanut (_Arachis hypogaea_ (Linné)) crop (Fig. 2a). The burning of forest provides nutrient rich ash and light for
crops. Peanut is cultivated as cash crop and is transformed into peanut oil. A part of the production is at the destination of the national market but most of it is exported outside Madagascar, mainly for the Chinese market (Fig. 3). Maize is cultivated for auto-consumption and as cash crop. The production of maize is at the destination of the national market and is used in particular to brew national beers, such as the Three Horse Beer (THB) by the Malagasy company Star (bought in 2011 by the French company Castel) which is made from both barley and maize (Fig. 3). Peanut and maize are sold by farmers to resellers at the price of 7000 Malagasy francs (MGF) (equivalent to 1400 Malagasy ariary, MGA) and 2000 MGF (400 MGA) per kilo, respectively. For 2016, the production for a household was of 1.6 tonnes (T) of peanut and 2.5 T of maize, thus providing an annual income of about 3.24 millions MGA. With the money earned from the sale of the maize and peanut harvest, farmers invest in buying zebu cows (_"omby"_).

We identified three causes of deforestation in the study area around the Kirindy-Mitea national park (Fig. 2b). Slash-and-burn agriculture for maize crops was identified as the main cause of deforestation in several areas at the periphery of the protected area (Fig. 2b, label A). Inside the protected area, uncontrolled fires were identified as the main cause of deforestation (Fig. 2b, label B). People repeatedly set fire on former grasslands (_"bozake"_) outside the protected area to obtain flush of green pasture for their livestock. When uncontrolled, fires can spread on large areas of the forest and cross the boundaries of the protected area. In 2009, the cyclone named _"Fanele"_ impacted a large area of the forest in the Kirindy-Mitea national park leaving a lot of wood fuel on the ground. This has allow uncontrolled fires to spread on large areas of the park in the years following the cyclone (Fig. 2b, label B). These fires were difficultly stopped with buckets of water and sand by the agents of the park with the help of the local people from surrounding villages. Illegal logging was also identify as a cause of deforestation in Kirindy-Mitea (Fig. 2b, label C). Timbers are mainly used for house and boat construction and sold in local markets in Belo-sur-Mer and Morondava. 

![Figure 3: **Main causes of deforestation in central Menabe.** **a-a'**: _Slash-and-burn agriculture (_"hatsake"_) for peanut crop._ Peanut (a') is cultivated as a cash crop. Part of the production is at the destination of the national market but most of it is exported outside Madagascar, mainly for the Chinese market. **b-b'**: _Slash-and-burn agriculture for maize crop._ maize (b') is cultivated for auto-consumption and as a cash crop. The production of maize is at the destination of the national market and is used in particular to brew the national beers. **c-c'**: _Cyclone followed by uncontrolled fires._ Cyclone _"Fanele"_ (2009) caused tree mortality and accumulation of wood fuel on the ground. As a consequence, uncontrolled fires set on nearby pastures (c') spread over large areas of forest after 2009. **d-d'**: _Illegal logging._ Timbers are used for house and boat construction.](figs/causes.jpg)

#### 3.2.2 Socio-economic causes of deforestation

##### Population growth

Population increase in central Menabe, associated to demographic growth and migration have accentuated the pressure on forest. The population of the Kirindy-Village and Lambokely villages (Fig. 2a) have been roughly multiplied by 5 between 2010 and 2015 (from about 600 to 3000 inhabitants for Kirindy-Village and from 1000 to 5000 for Lambokely). This was both due to demographic growth and migration. The demographic rate in Madagascar is close to 3%.yr<sup>-1</sup> [@Vieilledent2013] which means that the population doubles each 25 years on average. In Lambokely and Kirindy villages, the family we surveyed had all more than six children. Also the possibility of cropping cash crops have attracted many people from the south of Madagascar during the last years, in particular from the _"Androy"_ region. First migrants arrived in the central Menabe to work in large agricultural concessions authorized by the French colonial government. Notably, many _"Antandroy"_ migrants have arrived in the 1960s and established near the Beroboka village (located between Kirindy village and Lambokely) to work in the sisal (_Agave sisalana_ (Perrine, 1838)) plantations of the de Haulme family which are now abandoned. 

##### No application of conservation measures

Forest clearance is illegal in Madagascar since 1987 (Décret n°87-143, 20 April 1987), even outside the protected areas. However, the law is not respected nor applied. Almost nobody is prosecuted for forest clearance. During our stay in the field, seven people were arrested for doing slash-and-burn agriculture but were relaxed a few days later. The political crisis of 2009, followed by several years of political instability, have reinforced this state of lawlessness. Indeed, many politics in Madagascar are also business leaders. Moreover, authorities have often economic interests in not stopping deforestation as they are often involved in the trade associated with cash crops. Regarding the institutes in charge of the management of the protected areas, such as the NGO Fanamby for the Menabe-Antimena new protected area or Madagascar National Park for the Kirindy-Mitea national parks, they have no means to enforce the laws. Their unique role concerning forest conservation in the field is to make populationx aware of the forest conservation issues, to inventory and monitore the biodiversity in the parks and to organize patrols to prevently avoid forest clearance or report offenses. But in any case they have the right to arrest people or to draw up a report and decide on a fine. Other NGOs can pay people from local communities (named _"polis ny ala"_) to patrol the forest but they have practically no power and will difficultly report illegal acts from known neighbours or relatives.

### 3.3 Projected deforestation

Following the conservative scenario S1 (projecting 1990-2010 mean annual deforestation) and the worst-case scenario S2 (projecting 2000-2014 mean annual deforestation), we predicted that 36-55% of the forest present in 2000 will have disappeared in 2050 (Table 2). On the period 2000-2014, around 17% of the forest have already disappeared. Forest in 2050 should remain preferentially in the protected areas but deforestation should not stop at the boundaries of the parks (Fig. 2c and 2d). The model predicted that deforestation in the future should occur close to places were deforestation occurred in the past, thus correctly simulating the contagious process of deforestation (Fig. 2). Deforestation is also more likely to occur at short distances to villages and roads and in the forest edge (Fig. 2c and 2d). Forest fragmentation is also predicted to increase in association to deforestation (see the higher number of disconnected forest patches in Fig. 2c and 2d). Comparing Fig. 2c and 2d with Fig. 2a and 2b, we can see that almost all the deforestation on the period 2010-2014 is included in the deforested area predicted by the model on the period 2010-2050, thus validating in part the predictions of the location of the future deforestation.

Table 3: **Evolution of the forest cover with time in the Kirindy-Mitea national park (KMNP) and the Menabe-Antimena new protected area (MANAP).** _Area_: land area (in ha). _F2000_, _F2010_ and _F2014_: forest area (in ha) for the years 2000, 2010 and 2014, respectively. _F2050_: projected forest area (in ha) for the year 2050. About `r loss.2014`% of the forest have disappeared on the period 2000-2014 in the two sites and we predict the loss of around `r loss.S1.2050`% and `r loss.S2.2050`% of the forest on the period 2000-2050 for the two sites assuming a conservative (projecting the 1990-2010 annual deforestation) or a worst-case scenario (projecting the 2000-2014 annual deforestation), respectively.  

## 4. Discussion

### 4.1 Historical deforestation, projections and consequences (climate-change, biodiversity)

Compare with @Scales2011.

In a study analyzing the deforestation patterns in Kirindy-Ambadira Forest
Complex, @Zinner2014 found similar results to ours regarding the future deforestation. @Zinner2014 showed that half of the forest will have disappeared in 2043 in comparison to 1973 assuming a deforestation rate similar to the one over the period 1992-2010.

### 4.2 Causes of deforestation

#### 4.2.1 Deforestation is not associated to poverty and scarcity of productive land

The annual income we computed associated to the selling of cash crops (of about 3.24 millions MGA) is relatively high compared to the median household income of 1013 USD or 2.02 millions MGA (data aggregated from household surveys on the period 2006-2012 by The Gallup Organization, we used the USD-MGA mean change rate on the period 2006-2012: 1 USD = 1998 MGA). With the money earned from the sale of the maize and peanut harvest, farmers invest in buying zebu cows (_"omby"_). Buying zebu cow is a way for farmers of saving money such as a bank would do it. In Madagascar, zebu cows represent status, wealth, and cultural identity [@Hobbs2016]. People's diet in the Menabe region is significantly different from people's diet in the highlands which heavily relies on rice. In the Menabe region, rural people eat mainly manioc (_Manihot esculenta_ (Crantz)), wild and cultivated yams (_Dioscorea spp._) and maize [@Falola2015]. Notably, the main purpose of the slash-and-burn agriculture is not to obtain food for subsistence but to cultivate cash crop in order to invest in livestock.

- Exporters, domestic transporters, and corrupt officials reap most of the profits.

#### 4.2.2 Link between deforestation and climate-change

Climate-change could indirectly be identified as a cause of deforestation in the central Menabe region. It is now largely recognized that climate change can increase the number of extreme climatic events such as droughts, floods and cyclones (ref. X). Severe droughts in southern Madagascar in the recent years (since 2010), that could be attributed to climate-change [@Vieilledent2016], has led to famine events and can explain the migration of thousand of people in the villages of Kirindy and Lambokely which has led to an increase of the deforestation associated to slash-and-burn agriculture (Fig. 2a). Moreover, the decrease of precipitation in the recent years (2010-2014), that can be associated to climate change, can have increase the frequency and magnitude of spontaneous or anthropogenic uncontrolled fires. 

- Drought -> spontaneous uncontrolled fires -> deforestation -> deforestation
- Climate-change -> Extreme events (cyclone) -> more wood fuel -> large uncontrolled fires
- Droughts -> starvation in southern Madagascar -> migration -> slash-and-burn agriculture -> deforestation

### 4.3 Strategies to stop deforestation

#### 4.3.1 Increasing sensibilisation

- We know conserving forest is important at the global scale to avoid carbon emissions and mitigate climate and to conserve the biodiversity and related ecosystem services.
- But we need to insist on the importance of dry forest at the local scale (effect on climate, desertification, on natural resources: wood and game, water availability)
- Sensibilisation on the risk associated to the application of the law (fines and jail)
- Women education and family planning

#### 4.3.2 Increasing repressive mesures against deforestation

- Won't be possible without a political will (_"volonté politique"_)
- Reinforcement of the institutes in charge of the protected areas and applying the conservation measures
- Application of the law banning deforestation (fines and jail)
- Possibility for the guards to draw up a report
- Help of the army
- International pressure on Malagasy government, conditionality of the international help for development
- Decreasing migration

#### 4.3.3 Development of alternatives to deforestation

- Agricultural development (compost) to increase land productivity
- Other sources of income (tourism)
- Tree plantations for wood energy and construction
- REDD+
- Most of these development approaches have failed in the past or obtained limited positive impacts. We believe that change in behaviors will be facilitated by the application of the law and the repressive measures. Population will adapt to the context of law reinforcment finding, developping and investing in new sources of income.
